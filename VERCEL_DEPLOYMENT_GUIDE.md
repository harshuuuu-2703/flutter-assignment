# Fix Vercel 404 Error - Complete Guide

## The Problem
You're getting a 404 NOT_FOUND error because Vercel can't find your Flutter web app files.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Build Your Flutter App Locally
```bash
flutter build web --release
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (Choose ONE method)

#### Method A: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. **CRITICAL**: In the "Root Directory" field, enter: `build/web`
5. **CRITICAL**: Leave "Build Command" empty
6. **CRITICAL**: Leave "Output Directory" empty
7. Click "Deploy"

#### Method B: Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Deploy (make sure build/web exists)
vercel

# When prompted:
# - Set up and deploy? Y
# - Which scope? (choose your account)
# - Link to existing project? N
# - Project name: (enter a name)
# - In which directory is your code located? ./build/web
```

#### Method C: Drag and Drop
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Drag the entire `build/web` folder to the deployment area
3. Deploy

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
- Your app should be accessible at the provided Vercel URL
- All routes should work (no more 404 errors)

## Important Notes

### ✅ What's Fixed:
- Removed `outputDirectory` from vercel.json (causes conflicts)
- Updated routing configuration for SPA
- Optimized cache headers for Flutter web assets
- Created proper deployment guide

### ❌ Common Mistakes:
- Don't set output directory in Vercel dashboard if using vercel.json
- Don't set build command if you're pre-building locally
- Make sure `build/web` directory exists before deploying

### 🔧 If Still Getting 404:
1. Check that `build/web/index.html` exists
2. Verify you're setting the root directory to `build/web` in Vercel
3. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
4. Try deploying just the `build/web` folder directly

## File Structure After Build:
```
your-project/
├── build/
│   └── web/          ← This is what Vercel needs
│       ├── index.html
│       ├── main.dart.js
│       ├── assets/
│       ├── canvaskit/
│       └── ...
├── lib/
├── vercel.json
└── ...
```

## Quick Test:
```bash
# Test locally first
cd build/web
python -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

If this works locally, it will work on Vercel!
